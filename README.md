    These Python scripts analyze the NYC taxi trip data and make some 
interesting plots. You should work in Python interactively, first running 
execfile('probDistLongTrips.py').
    You will have to download the .csv files from 
http://www.andresmh.com/nyctaxitrips/
and put them into a directory called
trip_data/
